Hi Greg! 
I saw your Github profile had this starter for a personal blog, so I thought
> Why not!?

After days of scouring the internet, I finally landed on GatsbyJS starters, because
1. There were seriously NO good themes for Nikola.
2. I didn't like the UI provided by Pelican.
3. Gatsby looked good enough to be my blog :tongue:
4. I did *not* wish to learn Front-end for the next month to make the Gatsby site out of documentation!
5. Greg has made a masterpiece out of all the techs in the left bottom of the start page!

When I started looking for themes beforehand in [GatsbyJS starters](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/), and landed on your GitHub, I was elated only to find out you had [the perfect fit](https://github.com/greglobinski/gatsby-starter-personal-blog) waiting to be found!

Next up, I will be moving all my posts from [Wordpress](https://mindretfarc.wordpress.com) over here and publishing some new ones soon.
