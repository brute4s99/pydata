> Hi there!

I am Piyush Aggarwal, a Computer Science Engineering undergraduate student currently in my third year (graduating by June 2020) from MAIT, New Delhi, India. 

I’m an open source contributor and a developer. Ever since I attended that first meetup of ILUG-D​(India Linux Users Group - Delhi), that community has become my second home. I have been a volunteer, speaker, organizer, contributor, mentor and mentee and spend most of time working with and for FOSS.

My interest lies in developing tangible solutions that make good use of the resources at hand , and in my free time I experiment with technologies and tools mostly around this.
